Principles
-- Have a vision, sharpen it, iterate it
-- refactor your code, make it audrey lorde readable
-- Goal is to get a dollar from a stranger / job / have fun
-- "hit the user on the head" UI Features
-- Bic lighter is inspiration (the button getting colorful is sparks, led turning on is flame)
-- #1 is changeability



Doing:
--Selector for modes
--component /slice

UI:
-- selector for (modes , lightpatterns, and saved) // will need slices for all these
--fix main button (make icons its opposite color of background), only two screens, pretty halo effect of ripple leaving when activated, disable functions
-- add purchase tile in devices
-- add more icons!
-- feedback angle lights top third of screen
-- allow for pulse of different colors for the feedback mechanism (border and angel and items)
-- vibration
-- nuanced screen swipe sensitivity
-- way to save and edit saved shows
-- halo light responds to motion
-- make gesture handler size of entire screen
-- welcome greeting
--transform errors into satisfying and actionable UI feedback

FUNCTIONALITY:
--persistent data of connectedDev
--background mode performance
--smoothing functions
-- dynamic data reading (array length)
-- code modes
-- multi-BT functionality
--file saving

ORGANIZATION:
-- modular selection queries
-- continue to globalize styles

LT NOTES
-- Micro concert will need to randomly generated UU ID, because there will be issues with connecting multiple if they have the same. Or at least I am anticipating. This could also become an issue if I want to remember devices and the UU ID changes and I can't remember them.
