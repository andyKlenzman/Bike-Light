Doing:

- Sync BT and microcontroller
  -- try a while loop
    -- works better, but still not stopping or there is a million unfillfilled promises, will have to figure that out. Also, still blinking. 
    -- may still need the interval to set pace. Got to figure out what to do with blocking functions.
  -- Test data being and sent and recieved rate side by side
  -- Could the buffer be stagnating it??

To-do:

- Figure out why data keeps being sent after the setInterval has been stopped
- Need a way to cache bluetooth data and to run in background / keep screen awake
- Performance bugs (there are lots of them)
  -- global BT
  -- 
- test response from microcontroller
- error handling for disconnect 
- format sensor data
 -- check transformData function/map round number
ST NOTES:
- Will make data transofmration function more flexible, just need to start right now with a basic arcitecture. Making choices that dont serve me know in terms of design, but that include things that I know Ill need, sicj as a specific function for mapping and a function for configuring how data is being transformed for the microcontorller

  Approach:

LT Notes:
- This is just like painting, finding the ofrm that works from nothing
- There will be the problem of distonguishing what data set is coming from what sensor. Could it be based on an order? 
- bluetooth setup (can i add connected devices to the list? What to do when someone is connected to a device but not through the app?? Hit them in the head)
- multi device communication
- Build the simplest thing possible and evolve from there, cant predict the architecture yet
- OGTPY hooks are only able to be called at the lowest level. Is it for design reasons technical limitations does it in force a certain pattern that is beneficial in app development.
