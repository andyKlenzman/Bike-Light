/*
Check: 
 - Clean up proj (did I break anything)
 - Check BT (once i've installed BLE PLX), lots of debugging to do.
Doing:
    - implement all sensors in practice

To-do:
  - Initial BT structure.
  - Test BT Functionality (with set interval)
  - Install BLE PLX
  - begin implementation of BT (call function into bt, will it work)

ST NOTES:
 - 
 - WAIT!! it doesn't need to be passed as props, just call read sensors to BT / animated componetns and it should work.
 - realized passing this data as a function works better than use context. Only upcoming issue I can imagine is that the data gets fucked when reading it in BT and animation, but that seems unlikely. 
LT Notes:
 - call readSensors in BT and the other and see if they run okay. If it has a dip in performance, consider revisitng useContext to centralize the source of data instead of calling two straeas. I wonder how it will run....
